The purpose of this site is to document and share information about the *Database 4 Everything* project. The goal of this project is to is to create a single object database to store information about everything that I'm interested in tracking. 

The underlying technology is based on ZODB a Python object database using a schema which models the class and activity diagrams of the *db4e* classes.

Stay tuned for updates!
